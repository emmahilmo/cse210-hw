//Write a new entry - Show the user a random prompt (from a list that you create), 
//and save their response, the prompt, and the date as an Entry.
//Display the journal - Iterate through all entries in the journal and display them to the screen.
//Save the journal to a file - Prompt the user for a filename and then save the current journal 
//(the complete list of entries) to that file location.
//Load the journal from a file - Prompt the user for a filename and then load the journal
//(a complete list of entries) from that file. This should replace any entries currently stored the journal.
//Provide a menu that allows the user choose these options
//Your list of prompts must contain at least five different prompts. Make sure to add your own prompts to the list, 
//but the following are examples to help get you started:
//Who was the most interesting person I interacted with today?
//What was the best part of my day?
//How did I see the hand of the Lord in my life today?
//What was the strongest emotion I felt today?
//If I had one thing I could do over today, what would it be?

//Design requirements:
//Contain classes for the major components in the program.
//Contain at least two classes in addition to the Program class.
//Demonstrate the principle of abstraction by using member variables and methods appropriately.
